# setup-workstation

My personal workstation setup script, after having to do it all manually one too many times.

This is heavily inspired by [Bosh Workstation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-workstation).

Running install.sh will install the following:

* zsh
* dotfiles and aliases
* chruby with latest ruby
* postgresql

** NOTE THAT THIS IS A WIP **
